## Our Mission

The casuarina species of tree, also known as the Australian Pine, was introduced to Florida in the late 1800's.

### Environmental Issues

Australian pines are known for the shade, but they are invasive to Florida and can present major environmental issues:

1. Their shade blocks sunlight from native plant species.
2. Australian Pines accelerate the rate of beach erosion.
3. They can take over sea turtle nesting areas due to their rapid, invasive growth rate.
4. Australian pines are not real pine trees; they only resemble them. These trees cannot provide food and a habitat for native bird species.
5. Due to their impressive height (*they can grow up to 100 feet tall!*), Australian pines can cause severe damage when they blow over during hurricanes.

### Florida Pine Rescue's Solution

Florida Pine Rescue (FPR) helps to mitigate these issues. We remove casuarina trees from private property and use the wood to make pianos, keeping Florida homeowners safe from hurricane damage and turning a critical issue into a sustainable solution.

Along with our work in forestry and piano manufacturing, FPR's Casuarina Invasive Research Initiative, or CIRI, maintains the most cutting-edge research on Australian Pines. With CIRI, Florida Pine Rescue expands beyond just private property owners. The purpose of CIRI is to educate the broader public about casuarina trees so that they are also removed from Florida state property (beaches, parks, roads and highways, and especially wildlife management and conservation areas).

Here is an overview of the CIRI initiative's work:

## CIRI - Overview

1. **Photo Analysis with AlexNet**
Using the AlexNet convolutional neural network, photos are analyzed to a. identify Australian pines and b. differentiate them from other trees:

2. **Training Phase**

  Accurate identification of Australian pines helps FPR use AI technology to identify the trees over large areas of land, saving energy and increasing efficiency. It also helps prevent the accidental deforestation of native and/or beneficial tree species in Florida.

4. **Feature Map Analysis**

   CIRI uses tools such as feature map analysis to continually improve the accuracy and efficiency of its models:

5. **Public Education and Visualization**

   CIRI's research for public education has a focus on visualization, ensuring that our results are understandable to people of any and every educational background:

## Piano Manufacturing: A Sustainable Solution
Introducing a unique approach to sustainability, FPR transforms invasive Australian pine trees into upright or grand pianos, combining environmental conservation with craftsmanship.

- **Longevity:** Pianos can last for generations with proper maintenance, reducing the need for new production and electronic waste.
- **Sustainable Materials:** FPR uses responsibly managed wood and eco-friendly finishes, reducing environmental impact.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Pianos require no electricity or batteries, making them energy-efficient compared to electronic instruments.
- **Low Carbon Footprint:** Piano production has a relatively low carbon footprint, offset by the instrument's longevity.
- **Natural Sound:** Pianos produce rich, organic sound without amplification, reducing energy consumption.
- **Connection to Nature:** Pianos made from casuarina wood foster an appreciation for nature and sustainability.
- **Reduced Electronic Waste:** Pianos have a longer lifespan, reducing electronic waste in the music industry.
