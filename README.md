# Who are we?

The casuarina species of tree, also known as the Australian Pine, was introduced to Florida in the late 1800's.

Australian pines are known for the shade, but they are invasive to Florida and can present major environmental issues:
1. Their shade blocks sunlight from native plant species.
2. Australian Pines accelerate the rate of beach erosion.
3. They can take over sea turtle nesting areas due to their rapid, invasive growth rate.
4. Australian pines are not real pine trees; they only resemble them. These trees cannot provide food and a habitat for native bird species.
5. Due to their impressive height *they can grow up to 100 feet tall!), Australian pines can cause severe damage when they blow over during hurricanes.

Florida Pine Rescue (FPR) helps to mitigate these issues. We remove casuarina trees from private property and use the wood to make pianos, keeping Florida homeowners safe from hurricane damage and turning a critical issue into a sustainable solution.

Along with our work in forestry and piano manufacturing, FPR's Casuarina Invasive Research Initiative, or CIRI, maintains the most cutting-edge research on Australian Pines. With CIRI, Florida Pine Rescue expands beyond just private property owners. The purpose of CIRI is to educate the broader public about casuarina trees so that they are also removed from Florida state property (beaches, parks, roads and highways, and especially wildlife management and conservation areas).

Here is an overview of the CIRI initiative's work:
