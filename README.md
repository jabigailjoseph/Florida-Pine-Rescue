[What is Florida Pine Rescue?](https://github.com/jabigailjoseph/Florida-Pine-Rescue/blob/main/Florida%20Pine%20Rescue.pdf)

The casuarina species of tree, also known as the Australian Pine, was introduced to Florida in the late 1800's.

Australian pines are known for the shade, but they are invasive to Florida and can present major environmental issues:
1. Their shade blocks sunlight from native plant species.
2. Australian Pines accelerate the rate of beach erosion.
3. They can take over sea turtle nesting areas due to their rapid, invasive growth rate.
4. Australian pines are not real pine trees; they only resemble them. These trees cannot provide food and a habitat for native bird species.
5. Due to their impressive height *they can grow up to 100 feet tall!), Australian pines can cause severe damage when they blow over during hurricanes.
